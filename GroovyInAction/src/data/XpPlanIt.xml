1. idea: 
before command execution or selection, test whether the ApplyCanges Button in enabled.
if so, 
	ask
	if yes	
		TaskForm.saveInput()

-&gt; There seems to be trouble with the selection handling that interferes with the Task Data change. Dropped this idea...
[I just had a talk with Rolf that I should have used the IHasChangedListener on the TaskForm to set the dirty-flag]

alternatively
FORM_NOTIFATION_IMMEDIATE on TaskForm

-&gt; Implementation was fairly easy and straightforward. 
Additional benefits:
- UI shows more immediate response on data changes in the iteration panes
- less Buttons and Controllers
concern:
Performance with slow bandwith and http

DONE
as you see, there is no apply Button anymore....

I&apos;m not confident putting this together before having some more multi-user tests.

First version is to plainly restore the Release state and terminate().
